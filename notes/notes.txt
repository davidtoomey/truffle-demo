SOLIDITY CHEAT SHEET

  STRUCT: 
      


  MODIFIERS:
    Restrict who can make modifications to your contract's state or call your contract's functions and this is what this section is about.

    Ex: 
      modifier onlyBy(address _account)
    {
        require(msg.sender == _account);
        // Do not forget the "_;"! It will
        // be replaced by the actual function
        // body when the modifier is used.
        _;
    }

  DATA LOCATION: 
    Complex types i.e. *arrays* and *structs* have an additional annotation, "data location", to specify whether to be stored in *memory* or in *storage*.

  The default data location for function parameters (including return parameters( is *memory*, default data location for local variables is *storage* and location is forced to *storage* for state variables (obviously?)

  There is a third data location, calldata, which is a non-modifiable, non-persistent area where function arguments are stored. Function parameters (not return parameters) of external functions are forced to calldata and behave mostly like memory.

  Everytime you send data to storage, memory, or to a state variable (even from other state variables), it creates an independent copy.

  ARRAYS:
    Arrays can have a compile-time fixed size or they can be dynamic. For storage arrays, the element type can be arbitrary (i.e. also other arrays, mappings or structs). For memory arrays, it cannot be a mapping and has to be an ABI type if it is an argument of a publicly-visible function.

    



PHILLY HOLD'EM

  The game plays similar to Texas Hold'em except you get dealt 3 cards, the turn brings 2 cards, and the river is is the 6th community card instead of the 5th. If a player wins 3 pots in a row, they get the button the n 
  Players must use 2 of their whole cards in combination with 3 community cards (like in PLO).

  No limit.

  SIDE-BETS

  After the last round of betting but before the cards are turned up and the winner is determined, players not in the hand can place side-bets on will win the pot.

  All players have seat (number) chips with #1-9 on them to specify the player they would like to bet on. 

  After the winner of the main pot is determined, the side-bets are settled. Winnings are split between those who correctly chose the winner of the pot.

  Side bet can be placed by players not in current hand at ANY TIME during the hand as long as they are not in the hand. 

  A caller of a side-bet must call within the round of betting that the side-bet was made in. 
    
    Example: Player in seat #1 has folded pre-flop. As the hand develops, seat #1 notices seat #6 bets big on the flop. He thinks seat #6 probably has the best hand because he is a nit and never bets big unless he has the nuts. Because of his hunch, Player #1 bets two green $25 chips and includes the #6 seat chip - indicating an open  wager of $50 in this round of betting only, that player #6 will win the pot. Now player in seat #3 sees the $50 sidebet on player #6 and thinks it is a bad bet. Player #3 had just won a big pot from seat #6, and thinks he might be on tilt. Player #3 then bets 2 green $25 chips with the seat #9 chip, indicating he accepts player #1's wager and is matching seat #1's wager that player #9 will win the pot. The river is dealt and player #6 goes all in. Player #9 calls. Player #6 turns over a full house and player #9 mucks his cards. Player #1 wins the $100 side pot.   

  If no one chooses the winner of the pot correctly, all side-bets are returned.

  House rake: 1% of the main pot + 1% of side-bet pot
